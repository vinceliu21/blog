        <p>This is about to feel good—finally getting something off my chest.</p>
<p>My GPA was a 3.986 in high school. I took 6 AP classes my Senior year, earning 5’s on a good majority of them. I was accepted into Carnegie Mellon and felt as if I was prepared for anything.</p>
<p>My GPA turned to a 1.86 in college. I failed out of an introductory Calculus course and was on the verge of academic probation from the university. </p>
<p>Man. What a difference half a year could make. In the span of only a few months, I went from a peak that I thought could only go higher to a moment of reflection where I wasn’t sure what had happened to my life. </p>
<p>Coming from a high school where the academics weren’t as rigorous, I was slapped in the face with the significant difference that a small research institute such as Carnegie Mellon presented. I ended up enduring a lot of struggle in my freshman year.</p>
<p>I won’t focus on that though because it’s not that the classes were difficult or anything. It’s the mentality that I brought over from high school and tried to apply in college that led to my difficult year. I never needed to accept any additional resources or help in academics prior to CMU. But I realized that it was different now as I couldn’t succeed utilizing the same old methods. I had to learn and adapt, to look outwards for help. </p>
<p>Honestly, I’ve embraced the lesson that seeking help is often an individual’s strongest asset. </p>
<p>I came back the next year fully determined to make use of the resources that my university provided. There was no shame in asking for additional help in academics. I was a tutor in high school and even now as I just finished my undergraduate degree, I’m a teaching assistant for a core electrical engineering course. </p>
<p>Below is the graph, from freshman fall to graduation, of my GPA progress. </p>
<p><img src="/blog/2017/09/10/Venting/graph.png" alt="Grades" title="Grades" width="60%" height="60%"></p>
<p>I know a ton of people in similar situations with their own stories. My only advice is to stay positive and determined. Whatever your circumstances, whether they be academic or personal, just know that there is nothing wrong in seeking any kind of help. </p>
<p>I started essentially from rock bottom that year and literally climbed a mountain in my grades. The truth for me and what I hope other people will take away is to never give up and never blame everything on yourself. Keep believing and outreach to others whatever your difficult situation may be. If you look around, I am sure that there are always plenty of resources available!</p>
