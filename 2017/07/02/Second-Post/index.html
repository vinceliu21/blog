<h1 id="need-more-voice-and-opinion-less-detail"><a href="#need-more-voice-and-opinion-less-detail" class="headerlink" title="need more voice and opinion, less detail"></a>need more voice and opinion, less detail</h1><p>I first just want to come out of the gate and say yes, I am from New Jersey and I am also a Philadelphia sports fan. Now some of you may think that’s completely normal, but some are probably thinking that’s a bit strage. Before we continue, let me take some time to explain why. More often than not, people often question why I support sports team from a different state and the usual sort of dialogue, after I start babble about everyting that is Eagles and Sixers, usually goes as such.</p>
<p>Person: “Oh you like Philly sports, but aren’t you from NJ?”</p>
<p>Me: “Yes..? And?”</p>
<p>Person: “Well isn’t Philadelphia in Pennsylvania?”</p>
<p>At this point is where I then I have to give my quick sad excuse for a geography lesson on Philadelphia’s relationship to NJ. And trust me, I am not good at geography. </p>
<p>(insert NJ image with where I live circled in relationship to Philly)</p>
<h2 id="A-Sad-day"><a href="#A-Sad-day" class="headerlink" title="A Sad day"></a>A Sad day</h2><p>So some of you probably already knew this about me, but for the readers who didn’t then I hoped that little intro provided some insight into my interests. Recently though, I had to change the cover of my blog to a Celtics nation photo. Yes.. I had to. I made a bet with a friend who was a devout Boston sports fan. I’ve included a photo below as reference for the readers who are seeing this after the one month bet I made to keep this up for.  </p>
<p>For those familiar with the city, Philadelphia has a ravid sports fan base. The city though has longed for success ever since the glorious Allen Iverson days and misconceptions about skipping practice. That’s when the “Process” started circa (2013) and in terms of the traditional sense of the word, it was a long tumultus one. However, with recent moves made by Bryan Colangelo and the 76ers front office that were built upon the 3 year legacy of who could be called the city’s Batman, Sam Hinkie, I was in a state of optimisim. We have the #1 overall pick in the last two years, the self-proclaimed Process himself in Joel Embiid, and more assets possibly imagineable. What could go wrong! </p>
<p>Letting this all get to me, I bet on the outcome of a Boston - Philly summer league game that showcased Philly’s #1 overall pick against Boston’s #3 pick, which was actually a pick swap leading up to the draft. Ending in true Philadelphia sports fashion, the young Sixers summer league team collapsed down the stretch missing their last 7 shots and losing by a point 89-88. It’s truly a shame because had I won the bet, my friend would’ve posted this poem he wrote praising the 76ers organization while lamenting the combo of Danny Ainge and Brad Stevens. </p>
<h2 id="Gambling"><a href="#Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Gambling"></a>Gambling</h2><p>Personally I feel like I’ve always joked about making small bets with friends, but never fully committing unless I feel rather confident in winning. That’s made that last bet feel so bad since I have so much faith in the remergence of Philadelphia basketball. </p>
<p>It’s really interesting though to look at the concept of one risking something of value for the chance of earning more back. Having turned the legal gambing age of 21, I’ve had a turn or two at the casinos in Vegas when I was there for CES. See, I’m the type of person that wants to know the exact details of everything. I’ll use the game Roulette as an example. Before I played, I spent at least 2-3 hours studying the probabilities</p>
