        <p>This is about to feel good.</p>
<p>My GPA was around a 3.986. I took 6 AP classes my Senior year. I got 5s on the AP Chem &amp;&amp; Calc AB/BC tests without studying. I got into the college of my choice and I was ready to make an impact.</p>
<p>My  a 1.86. I failed out of Calculus. I became entrapped in a hole that I thought was impossible to free myself from. </p>
<p>Man. What a difference half a year could make. In the span of only a few months, I went from a peak that I thought could only go higher to a moment of reflection where I wasn’t sure what had happened to my life. I am not looking for pity nor am I trying to brag. I am merely writing to share my story. Perhaps in hopes that it resonates with some who might be in similar situations.</p>
<p>In June of 2013, I graduated high school with my head held high. I was in the top percent of my class and never struggled with anything. The only B I ever got was Honors Biology freshman year. I held a plethora of leadership positions along with spreading myself across a majority of extracurricular activities. Later that same year in December – only 6 months later – I received an email from my university saying that my gpa had fallen below their academic probation line and if I don’t increase it the next semester, then I would be forced to leave for a year. Forced to leave??? That same year I thought I was at the top and now I was going to be FORCED to leave? </p>
<p>I became full of myself. And not the kind where I was bragging and showing off. No. The full of myself where I thought I could handle anything. I made myself into who I was in high school and thought I could do the same in college. I was that big fish in a little pond that I never told anyone about my grade situation, not even my mother. </p>
<p>That next semester, Freshman Spring, I managed to bring my overall GPA up to a 2.29. That was barely enough to just keep me in school. That was also one of the hardest semesters ever as I was trying just not to be kicked out. I wasn’t even thinking about A’s let alone B’s like I would have in high school. My mentality changed. For the next year or so, I could probably say I was a mess. My relationships deteriorated, I hit extreme bouts of depression, I sought therapy at my school’s counseling center, I isolated myself, but mainly I was just trying to figure out what the hell had happened. I slowly dissolved myself away from social circles and ended up in a hole.</p>
<p>In my period of reflection, plenty of thoughts had crossed my mind such as “Did I try to do too much?”, “Was I not seeking enough help?”, “Was university just too difficult for me?”, “Was I not working hard enough?”. I thought about everything, tried to remedy it all, and change anything I could. I blamed the world, everyone else, and myself. </p>
<p>I was wrong to do that though. I made a mistake. </p>
<p>Below you’ll find a graph of my GPA from freshman to senior year. </p>

<p>From an average of 2.29 my Freshman year, I just graduated from my university 3 months ago with an average GPA of 3.5 or better. I took harder classes, joined a sports team, found more extracurricular activities (BUGGY) for my fellow CMU readers. </p>
<p>Back then, I just hit a point where I didn’t believe anymore. I looked outwards for reasons to blame, but in reality I had the answer all along. It is fair to say that I had a tough transition from high school to college and that I was not hitting the books right. In all reality though, I hit a certain point of defeat where I believed I was not good enough. </p>
<p>For anyone out there in similar situations where maybe University seems too difficult or even life in general is hitting the rocks. Don’t give up. Keep believing in yourself and </p>
