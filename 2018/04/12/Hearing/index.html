        <p>Now what an exciting two days that was. Mark Zuckerberg just gave his testimony before Congress on Capitol Hill and it had everything from Cambridge Analytica and Aleksandr Kogan to muffin analogies and booster seats. While perhaps most of the 10 hour session was quite repetitive, since it was obvious Zuckerberg had done his homework on the questions the lawmakers might ask him, there were a few interesting spots in the hearing. </p>
<p>I’ll give a quick view of my opinion on a few points that stood out out to me, but obviously a transcript and a more comprehensive review can be found elsewhere. Now let’s get down to the ugly first.</p>
<h2 id="The-Ugly"><a href="#The-Ugly" class="headerlink" title="The Ugly"></a>The Ugly</h2><p>During Senator Maria Cantwell’s four minute allotted time to speak, she referred to Palantir, a well-known data mining company, as “Stanford Analytica”. While this might have been a sideways dig at Cambridge Analytica or Palantir’s capacity for similar data privacy issues, it would not be surprising if this was just a poor joke that showcased a lack of knowledge on behalf of the Senator. Actually, a majority of the Representatives were underprepared for the hearing and displayed a sense of tech illiteracy, failing to understand how Facebook worked or the underlying business infrastructure—Zuckerberg compared data rights to selling muffins. Instead of really getting down to the core issues of privacy protection or the specific changes needed to move forward from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Zuckerberg spent most of his time touching on the general surface level knowledge behind his organization. </p>
<p>There seems to be a major disconnect between the lawmakers in Washington and the tech leaders of Silicon Valley. This hearing was a testament to that fact and perhaps this is an issue that needs to be tackled first.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bad"><a href="#The-Bad" class="headerlink" title="The Bad"></a>The Bad</h2><p>Although it was clear that Zuckerberg had done his homework (I mean look at his notes below), there were some tough spots for him. </p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Photo of Zuck&#39;s notes, by AP&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/andyharnik?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="external">@andyharnik</a> <a href="https://t.co/wF0WAkDdI4" target="_blank" rel="external">pic.twitter.com/wF0WAkDdI4</a></p>&mdash; Stefan Becket (@becket) <a href="https://twitter.com/becket/status/983846618263891968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="external">April 10, 2018</a></blockquote></p>

<p>House member G. K. Butterfield, former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, scolded Zuckerberg for Facebook’s lack of diversity—especially when it came to leadership and C-suite positions. Representative Yvette Clarke questioned whether the lack of diversity within Zuckerberg’s leadership team kept Facebook from detecting Russian attempts to incite racial divisions. Zuckerberg stumbled in his response to these questions. </p>
<p>As an advocate of more diversity in technology related leadership positions, I agreed with the sentiments expressed by the Representatives. While there are obviously exceptions to this—Sundar, Satya, Dara—there is a major lack of diversity occupying Silicon Valley’s highest executive management positions. Although he fumbled at first, Mark Zuckerberg agreed there was an issue and would look to work with the Representatives on adding diversity to his leadership team.</p>
<p>Next, a recurring topic was this idea of regulation. The policymakers in Washington made it clear that Facebook, a company like all Silicon Valley giants, has perhaps gone unregulated for too long. Many Senators questioned Zuckerberg whether he believed a bill would need to be proposed that would regulate what Facebook did in regards to user data and how often their work would be required to be made public. Zuckerberg repeatedly avoided giving a quick response to these yes/no questions and instead gave elaborate digressions on how Facebook was apologetic and would work towards not making the same mistakes again. Senators and Representatives found this answer disappointing. </p>
<p>Whether we actually move towards a world where government regulations are placed on tech companies that have access to millions of personal user data, it was clear the current situation would not suffice. With further elections coming, other countries improving their technologies, and more individuals being connected to the Internet than ever before, there has to be better privacy regulations—whether the individual companies handle it themselves or government regulations mandate it.</p>
<h2 id="The-Good"><a href="#The-Good" class="headerlink" title="The Good"></a>The Good</h2><p>Overall, there was not a ton of new information uncovered about the Cambridge Analytica scandal or Facebook’s regulations on privacy protection that the public didn’t already know. It was obvious through Zuckerberg’s monotonous answers that he had been fully prepared for the testimony and whatever questions Congress threw at him. There were a few rough spots, but I believe Zuckerberg and his team have generally come away unscathed and will continue doing what they have already promised to do: new AI algorithms to detect fake news and propaganda along a doubling of Facebook’s security/privacy team. </p>
<h2 id="Moving-Forward"><a href="#Moving-Forward" class="headerlink" title="Moving Forward"></a>Moving Forward</h2><p>I firmly believe that an issue that needs to be addressed first is the lack of consistent communication between Washington and Silicon Valley. It is similar to how Elon Musk argues that the government needs to be more involved in the advancement of AI technologies. If Washington understood the underlying technology more and Silicon Valley would consider the negative impacts their products might have, then perhaps future Cambridge Analytical and Russian election interference scandals can be avoided. The leaders of the tech field and leaders of this country need a stronger relationship for any progress to be made involving both sides.</p>
