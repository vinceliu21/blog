I mean how often is it that someone actually takes a cross-country road trip?</p>
<p>Well it just happened to turn out that the perfect opportunity came up this past Summer. I was about to finish up my Spring term at CMU in Pittsburgh and start an internship at Samsung Research in California. Now instead of flying, I decided that this was the opportunity I was looking for and went all-in on this roadtrip!</p>
<p>This was the general path I decided to take. </p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/02/24/Trip/map.png" alt="Planned Path" title="Planned Path" width="50%"></p>
<p>I definitely wanted to stop in Chicago first because one of my close college friends who graduated a year prior was working there. </p>
<p>Not to mention there were the added benefits of Lake Michigan, the Chicago architecture, and a good old Chicago-style hot dog! We went to Portillo’s for the hot dog, which was pretty good. If anyone has any other recommendations for whenever I’m in the area then I’d be all ears.</p>

<p>Visiting Chicago for my first time, I planned to meet my friend at Millenium Park. It was both close to his work and contained landmarks that I’ve always to see in person. Albeit the day was a bit gloomy, the sights were still beautiful. </p>

<p>After I left Chicago, I began traveling West through a few states and it was in a small town on the border of Iowa and Nebraska where I experienced this sincere hospitality. I was coming up on the end of a long day’s drive when I arrived in Council Bluffs. I just needed a place to crash for the night and when I entered what looked like a building for truckers taking stops from their cross-country deliveries, I met a single woman at the counter. </p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/02/24/Trip/town.jpg" alt="Council Bluffs, Iowa" title="Council Bluffs, Iowa" width="60%" height="60%"></p>
<p>The woman greeted me—or actually everyone—like we were a part of her family. A night when I thought I’d just grab something quick from a fast food joint, she prepared a home cooked meal for all the vistors saying in her miniature hotel. </p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/02/24/Trip/chicken.jpg" alt="Dinner" title="Dinner" width="60%" height="60%"></p>
<p>This was the experience I was unconsiously looking for. Having stayed in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh area my entire life, the Midwest is a part of the country I did not have much personal interaction with. It was beautiful to see all the landmarks and changing scenary, but the random conversations and interactions with strangers made the trip. I suggest anyone traveling to visit a town somewhere they’ve never heard of! </p>

<p>I finished my trip traveling through the mountains of Colorado, salt flats of Utah, and deserts of California. Overall, although I took this trip by myself and had to start work in California, I highly recommend a cross-country road trip. And if that’s not to your liking then just travel to somewhere random and explore! The adventure and new experiences really made me appreciate taking this chance.</p>
