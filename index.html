        <p>I first just want to come out of the gate and say yes, I am from New Jersey and I am also a Philadelphia sports fan. Now some of you may think that’s completely normal, but some are probably thinking that’s a bit strange. Before we continue, let me take some time to explain why. More often than not, people question why I support sports teams from a different state and the usual sort of dialogue goes as such.</p>
<p>Person: “Oh you like Philly sports, but aren’t you from NJ?”</p>
<p>Me: “Yes..? And?”</p>
<p>Person: “Well isn’t Philadelphia in Pennsylvania?”</p>
<p>And then this is the point where I have to give my sad quick excuse for a geography lesson on Philadelphia’s relationship to NJ. And trust me, I am not good at geography. For the longest time I didn’t even know what state Kansas City was in. And.. now I bet half of you are wondering where Kansas City is. </p>
<img src="/blog/2017/07/11/Basketball/map.png" alt="My Place of Origin" title="My Place of Origin">
<p>Well there you go. It can clearly be seen that with my close proximity to the city of brotherly love, I would of course be obsessed with cheesesteaks and Philly sports.</p>
<h2 id="Unfortunate-Bet"><a href="#Unfortunate-Bet" class="headerlink" title="Unfortunate Bet"></a>Unfortunate Bet</h2><p>So some of you probably already knew this about me, but for the readers who didn’t then I hoped that little intro provided some insight into my interests. Recently though, I had to sadly change the cover of my blog to a Celtics Nation photo. Yes.. I had to. I made a bet with my friend Ryan, a devout Boston sports fan, on the outcome of a basketball game that pitted Boston against Philly. The bets were individualized, but I had to change both my social media and blog cover to atrocious images for a month. I’ve included a photo below as reference for the readers who are seeing this after the grueling one month passed.</p>
<img src="/blog/2017/07/11/Basketball/celts.png" alt="Blog Cover 7/11/17" title="Blog Cover 7/11/17">
<p>For those familiar with the city, Philadelphia has a ravid sports fan base. The city though has longed for success ever since our glorious Allen Iverson days. That’s when the “Process” started circa (2013) and in terms of the traditional sense of the word, it was a long tumultuous one. However, with recent moves made by Bryan Colangelo and the 76ers front office, built upon the 3 year legacy of who could be called the city’s liberator, Sam Hinkie; I was in a state of optimisim. Who could blame me! We have the #1 overall pick in the last two years, the self-proclaimed Process himself in Joel Embiid, and more assets than possibly imagineable. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Well shit went wrong.  </p>
<p>With my ego inflating like a hot air balloon, I confidently bet on a Philadelphia win. Oh and by the way, the game showcased Philly’s #1 overall pick against Boston’s #3 pick, which was actually a pick swap leading up to the draft. Ending in true Philadelphia sports fashion, the young 76ers summer league team collapsed down the stretch missing their last 7 shots and lost by a point (89-88). It’s truly a shame because had I won the bet, my friend would’ve posted a poem he wrote praising the 76ers organization, while lamenting the combo of Danny Ainge and Brad Stevens. </p>
<h2 id="Gambling"><a href="#Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Gambling"></a>Gambling</h2><p>Now you could probably assume I’ve learned my lesson or what not from that bet right? Well no.. I wouldn’t say I’m a gambling man, but personally I enjoy the thrill of it. To be honest though, I feel like I’ve always joked about making small bets with friends and never fully committing unless I feel rather confident in winning. That’s what made that last bet feel so bad since I have so much faith in the reemergence of Philadelphia basketball.</p>
<p>I’m a safe gambler. I’m the kind of guy that looks up the probabilities and odds of every return possibility in Roulette. I study the theory for the exact way to diminish losses in a casino game, while also looking for advantages against the house. People who gamble probably know that the house always has an advantage no matter what and that it’s never 50/50, let alone better to win. Well I can’t accept that because then why would I want to play a game where I always lose money? I like to think there has to be a way to win no matter the odds. You just have to look for it. Hopefully the 76ers organization will embrace that too. </p>

        <p>I’ve always thought about blogging. The idea just never stuck because I didn’t think I was a good enough writer. I was the kid that brought a pillow to school so I could nap comfortably during AP Lit. Even to this day, I still remember sitting in my chair, slightly drifting in and out of consciousness… awaking suddenly to that sudden jolt of falling. Have you ever wondered why that happens? Hypnic jerk–the involuntary twitch which occurs just as a person is beginning to fall asleep. Even my body was trying to tell me to pay attention in class.    </p>
<h2 id="Pilot-Post"><a href="#Pilot-Post" class="headerlink" title="Pilot Post"></a>Pilot Post</h2><p>Well I guess you could say I just lost my blogging virginity. That surprisingly was easier than I thought it would be. The site and everything are kind of rough around the edges right now so bear with me. Things will most likely, actually definitely change, along with more posts being added. These aforementioned posts contain, but are not limited to: the crazy crap I do, things I like to pretend I’m interested in, my very strong opinion about how Gal Gadot could make any man crawl at her feet. Just kidding.. Okay maybe not about that last one. Anyways whether I plan to use this blog as means of improving my writing or just somewhere to babble away endlessly, hope you guys enjoy what you see fam! </p>
