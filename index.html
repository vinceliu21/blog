<p>Ureshii (うれしい). That moment could have lasted forever and I don’t think I would have mind—five hours or so seemed to have blurred by in an instant. The bar staff slowly began to clean up and without even realizing until it was time to leave, we were the last ones there. It was the beauty of traveling—individuals unknown to each other just hours ago and now intimately sharing parts of their life stories. </p>
<p>Paying respect to the employees trying to close up for the night, we took our leave and walked outside. </p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/09/15/Japan/sun.jpg" alt="Sunrise" title="Sunrise" width="50%"></p>
<p>It was absolutely beautiful. The sun had begun to rise over Tokyo and in that moment I felt this unbelievable sense of being alive. All my senses felt amplified, just the sounds of the taxis and the brush of the wind was enough to make my hair stand. I was in love with the moment. Ureshii (うれしい)—a Japanese expression used as a term of happiness, a phrase I had learned from my new friends that night. And it was almost as if no one wanted the moment to end; we attempted to head to Tsukiji Fish Market, with the girls in heels and all, but the taxis refused a group of five people. </p>
<p>Traveling lets you experience the World—the food, the culture, the scenary, but most important, the people. My time in Japan probably still would have been amazing if we hadn’t met Mai and Akari that night, but it was all that much better to make new friends. </p>
<p>Thank you Mai and Akari! </p>

    </h1>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Now what an exciting two days that was. Mark Zuckerberg just gave his testimony before Congress on Capitol Hill and it had everything from Cambridge Analytica and Aleksandr Kogan to muffin analogies and booster seats. While perhaps most of the 10 hour session was quite repetitive, since it was obvious Zuckerberg had done his homework on the questions the lawmakers might ask him, there were a few interesting spots in the hearing. </p>
<p>I’ll give a quick view of my opinion on a few points that stood out out to me, but obviously a transcript and a more comprehensive review can be found elsewhere. Now let’s get down to the ugly first.</p>
<h2 id="The-Ugly"><a href="#The-Ugly" class="headerlink" title="The Ugly"></a>The Ugly</h2><p>During Senator Maria Cantwell’s four minute allotted time to speak, she referred to Palantir, a well-known data mining company, as “Stanford Analytica”. While this might have been a sideways dig at Cambridge Analytica or Palantir’s capacity for similar data privacy issues, it would not be surprising if this was just a poor joke that showcased a lack of knowledge on behalf of the Senator. Actually, a majority of the Representatives were underprepared for the hearing and displayed a sense of tech illiteracy, failing to understand how Facebook worked or the underlying business infrastructure—Zuckerberg compared data rights to selling muffins. Instead of really getting down to the core issues of privacy protection or the specific changes needed to move forward from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Zuckerberg spent most of his time touching on the general surface level knowledge behind his organization. </p>
<p>There seems to be a major disconnect between the lawmakers in Washington and the tech leaders of Silicon Valley. This hearing was a testament to that fact and perhaps this is an issue that needs to be tackled first.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bad"><a href="#The-Bad" class="headerlink" title="The Bad"></a>The Bad</h2><p>Although it was clear that Zuckerberg had done his homework (I mean look at his notes below), there were some tough spots for him. </p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Photo of Zuck&#39;s notes, by AP&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/andyharnik?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="external">@andyharnik</a> <a href="https://t.co/wF0WAkDdI4" target="_blank" rel="external">pic.twitter.com/wF0WAkDdI4</a></p>&mdash; Stefan Becket (@becket) <a href="https://twitter.com/becket/status/983846618263891968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="external">April 10, 2018</a></blockquote></p>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>House member G. K. Butterfield, former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, scolded Zuckerberg for Facebook’s lack of diversity—especially when it came to leadership and C-suite positions. Representative Yvette Clarke questioned whether the lack of diversity within Zuckerberg’s leadership team kept Facebook from detecting Russian attempts to incite racial divisions. Zuckerberg stumbled in his response to these questions. </p>
<p>As an advocate of more diversity in technology related leadership positions, I agreed with the sentiments expressed by the Representatives. While there are obviously exceptions to this—Sundar, Satya, Dara—there is a major lack of diversity occupying Silicon Valley’s highest executive management positions. Although he fumbled at first, Mark Zuckerberg agreed there was an issue and would look to work with the Representatives on adding diversity to his leadership team.</p>
<p>Next, a recurring topic was this idea of regulation. The policymakers in Washington made it clear that Facebook, a company like all Silicon Valley giants, has perhaps gone unregulated for too long. Many Senators questioned Zuckerberg whether he believed a bill would need to be proposed that would regulate what Facebook did in regards to user data and how often their work would be required to be made public. Zuckerberg repeatedly avoided giving a quick response to these yes/no questions and instead gave elaborate digressions on how Facebook was apologetic and would work towards not making the same mistakes again. Senators and Representatives found this answer disappointing. </p>
<p>Whether we actually move towards a world where government regulations are placed on tech companies that have access to millions of personal user data, it was clear the current situation would not suffice. With further elections coming, other countries improving their technologies, and more individuals being connected to the Internet than ever before, there has to be better privacy regulations—whether the individual companies handle it themselves or government regulations mandate it.</p>
<h2 id="The-Good"><a href="#The-Good" class="headerlink" title="The Good"></a>The Good</h2><p>Overall, there was not a ton of new information uncovered about the Cambridge Analytica scandal or Facebook’s regulations on privacy protection that the public didn’t already know. It was obvious through Zuckerberg’s monotonous answers that he had been fully prepared for the testimony and whatever questions Congress threw at him. There were a few rough spots, but I believe Zuckerberg and his team have generally come away unscathed and will continue doing what they have already promised to do: new AI algorithms to detect fake news and propaganda along a doubling of Facebook’s security/privacy team. </p>
<h2 id="Moving-Forward"><a href="#Moving-Forward" class="headerlink" title="Moving Forward"></a>Moving Forward</h2><p>I firmly believe that an issue that needs to be addressed first is the lack of consistent communication between Washington and Silicon Valley. It is similar to how Elon Musk argues that the government needs to be more involved in the advancement of AI technologies. If Washington understood the underlying technology more and Silicon Valley would consider the negative impacts their products might have, then perhaps future Cambridge Analytical and Russian election interference scandals can be avoided. The leaders of the tech field and leaders of this country need a stronger relationship for any progress to be made involving both sides.</p>

        <h2 id="Road-trip"><a href="#Road-trip" class="headerlink" title="Road trip"></a>Road trip</h2><p>So I’m going to talk about something I’ve always thought about doing, but never really knowing when I’d have the chance. I mean how often is it that someone actually takes a cross-country road trip?</p>
<p>Well it just happened to turn out that the perfect opportunity came up this past summer. I was about to finish up my spring term at CMU in Pittsburgh and start an internship at Samsung Research in California. Now instead of flying, I decided that this was the opportunity I was looking for and went all-in on this roadtrip!</p>
<p>This was the general path I decided to take. </p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/02/24/Trip/map.png" alt="Planned Path" title="Planned Path" width="50%"></p>
<p>I definitely wanted to stop in Chicago first because one of my close college friends who graduated a year prior was working there. </p>
<p>Not to mention there were the added benefits of Lake Michigan, the Chicago architecture, and a good old Chicago-style hot dog! We went to Portillo’s for the hot dog, which was pretty good. If anyone has any other recommendations for whenever I’m in the area then I’d be all ears.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/02/24/Trip/chicago_pan.jpg" alt="The Bean!" title="Planned Path"></p>
<p>Visiting Chicago for my first time, I planned to meet my friend at Millenium Park. It was both close to his work and contained landmarks that I’ve always to see in person. Albeit the day was a bit gloomy, the sights were still beautiful. </p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/02/24/Trip/bean_selfie.jpg" alt="Reflection off the Bean" title="Reflection off the Bean" width="60%" height="60%"></p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/02/24/Trip/chicago_arch.jpg" alt="Chicago Architecture" title="Chicago Architecture" width="60%" height="60%"></p>
<p>After I left Chicago, I began traveling west through a few states and it was in a small town on the border of Iowa and Nebraska where I experienced this sincere hospitality. I was coming up on the end of a long day’s drive when I arrived in Council Bluffs. I just needed a place to crash for the night and when I entered what looked like a building for truckers taking stops from their cross-country deliveries, I met a single woman at the counter. </p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/02/24/Trip/town.jpg" alt="Council Bluffs, Iowa" title="Council Bluffs, Iowa" width="60%" height="60%"></p>
<p>The woman greeted me—or actually everyone—like we were a part of her family. A night when I thought I’d just grab something quick from a fast food joint, she prepared a home cooked meal for all the vistors staying in her miniature hotel. </p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018/02/24/Trip/chicken.jpg" alt="Dinner" title="Dinner" width="60%" height="60%"></p>
<p>This was the experience I was unconsiously looking for. Having stayed in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh area my entire life, the Midwest is a part of the country I did not have much personal interaction with. Of course it was beautiful to see all the landmarks and changing scenary, but the random conversations and interactions with strangers are what made the trip for me. I suggest anyone reading this to travel somewhere they’ve never heard of. Experience the adventure of an unknown area and interact with the locals there. Meeting individuals from all different walks of life and getting to know their story is perhaps one of the greatest experiences. </p>

<p>I finished my trip traveling through the mountains of Colorado, salt flats of Utah, and beauty of California. I spent time to hike and explore the diverse aspects of nature. I was able to experience landscapes that are only unique to certain geographical areas. </p>
<p>Overall, although I took this trip by myself and had to start work in California, I highly recommend a cross-country road trip to anyone out there. And if that’s not to your liking then just travel to somewhere random and explore! The adventure and new experiences really made me appreciate taking this opportunity. I’ll be traveling to Japan soon so look out for an upcoming blog post about that! Also once again, feel free to reach out for any specifics about my journey across America! </p>

        <p>This is about to feel good—finally getting something off my chest.</p>
<p>My GPA was a 3.986 in high school. I took 6 AP classes my Senior year, earning 5’s on a good majority of them. I was accepted into Carnegie Mellon and felt as if I was prepared for anything.</p>
<p>My GPA turned to a 1.86 in college. I failed out of an introductory Calculus course and was on the verge of academic probation from the university. </p>
<p>Man. What a difference half a year could make. In the span of only a few months, I went from a peak that I thought could only go higher to a moment of reflection where I wasn’t sure what had happened to my life. </p>
<p>Coming from a high school where the academics weren’t as rigorous, I was slapped in the face with the significant difference that a small research institute such as Carnegie Mellon presented. I ended up enduring a lot of struggle in my freshman year.</p>
<p>I won’t focus on that though because it’s not that the classes were difficult or anything. It’s the mentality that I brought over from high school and tried to apply in college that led to my difficult year. I never needed to accept any additional resources or help in academics prior to CMU. But I realized that it was different now as I couldn’t succeed utilizing the same old methods. I had to learn and adapt, to look outwards for help. </p>
<p>Honestly, I’ve embraced the lesson that seeking help is often an individual’s strongest asset. </p>
<p>I came back the next year fully determined to make use of the resources that my university provided. There was no shame in asking for additional help in academics. I was a tutor in high school and even now as I just finished my undergraduate degree, I’m a teaching assistant for a core electrical engineering course. </p>
<p>Below is the graph, from freshman fall to graduation, of my GPA progress. </p>
<p><img src="/blog/2017/09/10/Venting/graph.png" alt="Grades" title="Grades" width="60%" height="60%"></p>
<p>I know a ton of people in similar situations with their own stories. My only advice is to stay positive and determined. Whatever your circumstances, whether they be academic or personal, just know that there is nothing wrong in seeking any kind of help. </p>
<p>I started essentially from rock bottom that year and literally climbed a mountain in my grades. The truth for me and what I hope other people will take away is to never give up and never blame everything on yourself. Keep believing and outreach to others whatever your difficult situation may be. If you look around, I am sure that there are always plenty of resources available!</p>

        <p>I first just want to come out of the gate and say yes, I am from New Jersey and I am also a Philadelphia sports fan. Now some of you may think that’s completely normal, but some are probably thinking that’s a bit strange. Before we continue, let me take some time to explain why. More often than not, people question why I support sports teams from a different state and the usual sort of dialogue goes as such.</p>
<p>Person: “Oh you like Philly sports, but aren’t you from NJ?”</p>
<p>Me: “Yes..? And?”</p>
<p>Person: “Well isn’t Philadelphia in Pennsylvania?”</p>
<p>And then this is the point where I have to give my quick blurb for a geography lesson on Philadelphia’s relationship to NJ. </p>
<img src="/blog/2017/07/11/Basketball/map.png" alt="My Place of Origin" title="My Place of Origin">
<p>Well there you go. With my close proximity to the city of brotherly love, I would of course be obsessed with cheesesteaks and Philly sports. So yes I love Philadelphia and no I am not a Yankees, Jets, or any kind of New York fan (although I did root for the Giants against the Patriots in the 2008 Super Bowl).</p>
<h2 id="Unfortunate-Bet"><a href="#Unfortunate-Bet" class="headerlink" title="Unfortunate Bet"></a>Unfortunate Bet</h2><p>So some of you probably already knew this about me, but for the readers who didn’t then I hoped that little intro provided some insight into my interests. Recently though, I had to sadly change the cover of my blog to a Celtics Nation photo. Yes.. I had to. I made a bet with my friend Ryan, a devout Boston sports fan—perhaps even as crazy as the great Bill Simmons—, on the outcome of a basketball game that pitted Boston against Philly. The bets were individualized, but I had to change my blog cover to this for a month. I’ve included a photo below as reference for the readers who are seeing this after the grueling one month passed.</p>
<img src="/blog/2017/07/11/Basketball/celts.png" alt="Blog Cover 7/11/17" title="Blog Cover 7/11/17">
<p>For those familiar with the city, Philadelphia has a ravid sports fan base. The city though has longed for success ever since our glorious Allen Iverson days. That’s when the “Process” started circa (2013) and in terms of the traditional sense of the word, it was a long tumultuous one. However, with recent moves made by Bryan Colangelo and the 76ers front office, built upon the 3 year legacy of who could be called the city’s liberator, Sam Hinkie; I was in a state of optimisim. Who could blame me! We have the #1 overall pick in the last two years, the self-proclaimed Process himself in Joel Embiid, and more assets than possibly imagineable. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Well things went wrong.  </p>
<p>With my ego inflating like a hot air balloon, I confidently bet on a Philadelphia win. Oh and by the way, the game showcased Philly’s #1 overall pick against Boston’s #3 pick, which was actually a pick swap leading up to the draft. Ending in true Philadelphia sports fashion, the young 76ers summer league team collapsed down the stretch missing their last 7 shots and lost by a point (89-88). It’s truly a shame because had I won the bet, my friend would’ve posted a poem he wrote praising the 76ers organization, while lamenting the combo of Danny Ainge and Brad Stevens. </p>
<h2 id="Gambling"><a href="#Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Gambling"></a>Gambling</h2><p>Now you could probably assume I’ve learned my lesson about betting right? Well no.. I wouldn’t say I’m a gambling man, but personally I enjoy the thrill of it. Perhaps it’s the adventurous side to me or the part of me that loves taking risks—maybe even the resolve to always bet on myself. To be honest though, I feel like I’ve always joked about making small bets with friends and never fully committing unless I feel rather confident in winning. That’s what made that last bet feel so bad since I have so much faith in the reemergence of Philadelphia basketball.</p>
<p>You see. I’m a safe gambler. I’m the kind of guy that looks up the probabilities and odds of every return possibility in Roulette. I study the theory for the exact way to diminish losses in a casino game, while also looking for advantages against the house. People who gamble probably know that the house always has an advantage no matter what and that it is never 50/50, let alone better odds to win. Well I can’t accept that because then why would I want to play a game where I always lose money? I like to think there has to be a way to win no matter the odds (okay perhaps casino games aren’t the “best” examples), but you just have to look for it. Hopefully the 76ers organization will embrace that too. </p>

        <p>I’ve always thought about blogging. The idea just never stuck because I didn’t think I was a good enough writer. I was the kid that brought a pillow to school so I could nap comfortably during AP Lit. Even to this day, I still remember sitting in my chair, slightly drifting in and out of consciousness… awaking suddenly to that sudden jolt of falling. Have you ever wondered why that happens? Hypnic jerk–the involuntary twitch which occurs just as a person is beginning to fall asleep. Even my body was trying to tell me to pay attention in class.    </p>
<h2 id="Pilot-Post"><a href="#Pilot-Post" class="headerlink" title="Pilot Post"></a>Pilot Post</h2><p>Well there goes my first attempt, which was surprisingly easier than I thought it would be. The site and everything are kind of rough around the edges right now so bear with me. Things will most likely, actually definitely change, along with more posts being added. The future posts will most likely be about the crazy adventures I do, passionate interests of mine, and anything else on my mind. Anyways whether I plan to use this blog as means of improving my writing or just somewhere to babble away endlessly, hope you guys enjoy what you read!</p>
